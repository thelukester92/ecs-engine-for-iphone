ECS Engine for iPhone
===

This is a game engine designed for the iPhone platform using the Entity-Component-System architecture. At present, it is primarily for platformers, but is meant to be flexible and extensible so that it can work with any number of game types.

**This project is on hold!** I've stopped work on this engine in Objective-C in favor of a similar project using the new [Swift programming language.](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) Be sure to check out [my new project's repository here.](https://github.com/thelukester92/swift-engine)
